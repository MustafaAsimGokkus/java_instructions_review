package day29exceptions;
/*
 
 1)throws, throw, try, catch, finally compile time exception(checked), runtime exception (unchecked)
 2)Differences between throw and throws
   i)"throw" is used in method body but "throws" is used in method name line
   ii)After"throw" keyword we create an object by using Exception classes but after "throws" keyword
      we type just the name of Exception class
   iii)After "throws" keyword you can use multiple class names for exceptions but after "throw"
   keyword you can create just a single object.
   Note: After "throws" keyword parent and child Exception classes cannot be used together, java removes
         child and replace parent automatically
   iv)"throws" can be used once at most in a method but "throw" can be used many times in a method body.
